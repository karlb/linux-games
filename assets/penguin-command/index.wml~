	<ul>
	<li>Incredible! The graphics and sound are beautiful, especially the music, and I've yet to find a bug in the game. This is another
	excellent example of what can be achieved in open source games.
	<li>Best waste of my time I have managed to come up with yet. Enjoyable, well paced and challenging.
	<li>Really wonderfull ! [...]
	<li>Penguin Command was everything I hoped it would be, and more. The graphics are very well done, the gameplay is smooth, and the game is pleasantly addictive. I can 
	give this game no less than 5 stars.
	<li>I like it, nice sounds, nice graphics. It's fast enough on my K6-200.
	<li>Awesome game! Was just going through a menu and came across the icon...low and behold I find my now favorite Linux game!
